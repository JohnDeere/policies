# John Deere Open Source Project Privacy Statement

Thank you for participating in our open source projects.  We respect your information and want you to 
understand how we handle it.
  
In this forum, we collect only information you choose to share with us, and we process it with your consent or on 
another legal basis as explained below.  We require only the minimum amount of personal information necessary to 
enable your interaction with the projects; we do not sell your information to third parties, and we use it only 
as described in this notice.
  
## What information we collect and why

### Information from website browsers

If you are **just browsing the website**, we collect the same basic information that most websites collect. 
We use common internet technologies, such as cookies and web server logs.
 
The information we collect about all visitors to our site includes the visitor’s browser type, language 
preference, referring site, additional websites requested, and the date and time of each visitor request. 
We also collect usage information such as Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to better understand how our 
website visitors use our site, and to monitor and protect the security of the website.

### Information from users
 
Before you can participate in our projects, we require some basic information so that we know who you are and 
who you represent. You will create your own user name and password, and we will ask you for a valid email address. 
You also have the option to give us more information if you want to, and this may include 
"User Personal Information."

"User Personal Information" is any information about one of our users which could, alone or together with 
other information, personally identify him or her. Information such as a user name and password, an email 
address, a real name, and a photograph are examples of “User Personal Information.” User Personal Information 
includes Personal Data as defined in the General Data Protection Regulation.

User Personal Information does not include aggregated, non-personally identifying information. We may use 
aggregated, non-personally identifying information to operate, improve, and optimize our website and service.

#### Why we collect this information

* We need your User Personal Information to create your account, and to enable your participation in our projects.
* We use your User Personal Information, specifically your user name, to identify you in our projects and on our site.
* We use it to fill out your profile and share that profile with other users if you ask us to.
* We will use your email address to communicate with you about the project and closely related matters.  
* We use your User Personal Information for internal purposes, such as to maintain logs for security reasons, 
and for legal documentation, including documenting submission sources.
* We limit our use of your User Personal Information to the purposes listed in this Privacy Statement. 
If we need to use your User Personal Information for other purposes, we will ask your permission first.
 
#### Our legal basis for processing information

Under certain international laws (including laws in Europe), we are required to notify you about the legal basis on 
which we process User Personal Information. For these projects, we process User Personal Information on the 
following legal bases:

* When you create a profile in our project and with your consent, you provide your user name and an email address. 
We require those data elements for you to enter our site and organize your participation. 
* Generally, the remainder of the processing of personal information we perform is necessary for the purposes of our 
legitimate interests. For example, for security purposes, we must keep logs of IP addresses that access the site, 
and to respond to legal process, we are required to keep records of users who have sent and received DMCA takedown 
notices.
* We will also process information as necessary to comply with applicable laws and legal orders.  
	
### Repository contents

If you submit content to our project, we may host, publish, use, and share it consistent with our project mission 
and guidelines.  If you include private, proprietary, or sensitive information in a project, that information may 
be indexed by search engines or used by third parties. 

## What information we do not collect

We do not intentionally collect **sensitive personal information**, such as social security numbers, genetic data, 
health information, or religious information. Although we do not request or intentionally collect any sensitive 
personal information, we realize that you might store or submit this kind of information in the project. 
If you store any sensitive personal information on our servers or in the project, you are responsible for 
complying with any regulatory controls regarding that data.

If you are a **child under the age of 13**, you may not participate in the project. We do not knowingly collect 
information from or direct any of our content specifically to children under 13. If we learn or have reason to 
suspect that you are a user who is under the age of 13, we will unfortunately have to remove you from the 
project. We don't want to discourage you from learning to code, but those are the rules. Other countries may 
have different minimum age limits, and if you are below the minimum age for providing consent for data collection 
in your country, you may not participate in the projects or use the project site without obtaining your parents' 
or legal guardians' consent.

## How we share the information we collect

We share User Personal Information with your permission, so we can manage our project. For example, we will identify 
you about your submissions to the project.  

We **do not** share, sell, rent, or trade User Personal Information with third parties for their commercial purposes.

We **do not** host advertising on our site. We may occasionally embed content from third party sites, such as YouTube, 
and that content may include ads. While we try to minimize the number of ads our embedded content contains, we can't
 always control what third parties show. Any advertisements appearing on the site or in project submissions 
 repositories are not sponsored by, or tracked by, us.

We **do not** disclose User Personal Information outside the project, except when we are compelled to do so under a 
legal order or rule or when necessary to protect us or others from injury or fraud.

We **do** share certain aggregated, non-personally identifying information with others about how our users, 
collectively, use our site, or how our users respond to our other offerings, such as our conferences or events. 

We **do** share User Personal Information with a limited number of third party vendors (for example, GitHub, where 
we host the project repository) who process it on our behalf to provide or improve our service. They have agreed 
to privacy restrictions like our own Privacy Statement by signing data protection agreements. Note that information 
you submit to us will be processed in the United States and other counties. Where the latter is the case, we rely
on admissible data transfer mechanisms, such as Standard Contractual Clauses, Binding Corporate Rules or the US 
recipient’s Privacy Shield certification, if any.  

We **do** share aggregated, non-personally identifying information with third parties.

We may share User Personal Information if we are involved in a merger, sale, or acquisition. If any such change of 
ownership happens, we will ensure that it is under terms that preserve the confidentiality of User Personal 
Information, and we will notify you on our website or by email before any transfer of your User Personal Information. 
The organization receiving any User Personal Information will have to honor any promises we have made in our 
Privacy Statement or in our Terms of Service.

### Public information in the project

Much of the project is public-facing. If your submissions are public-facing, third parties may access and use them 
in compliance with our project guidelines and applicable licensing agreements.  

## Your right to access and control the information we collect

### Information

You are entitled to the information provided in this form.  

### Data access, correction, and portability

You may access, update, copy, and download submissions directly from the project site.  You may access your 
information and submissions directly via the project site.  

### Data retention and deletion of data, objection to processing, and withdrawal of consent

Generally, we will retain your information and submissions for as long as is needed to manage and maintain the site, 
including the need to document and verify the identity of submitting participants.  That is why we may retain 
certain User Personal Information indefinitely, even if you stop participating in the project and request deletion.  

If you wish to request deletion of data or generally to withdraw your consent or to object to processing (including 
any automated processing), please use our Data Subject Rights Request Form which is linked at 
[www.johndeere.com/privacy](http://www.johndeere.com/privacy). 

## Our use of cookies and tracking

### Cookies

We and our suppliers use cookies to make interactions with the site service easy and meaningful. We use cookies 
(and similar technologies, like HTML5 local Storage) to keep you logged in, remember your preferences, and provide 
information for future development of GitHub. We also use cookies to identify a device, for security reasons.
By using the project website, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your computer or device. 
If you disable your browser or device’s ability to accept cookies, you may not be able to access or use the project 
sites.

### Tracking and analytics

We and our suppliers use third party analytics and service providers to help use of the site; compile statistical 
reports on activity; and improve our content and website performance. We do not track your online browsing activity 
on other online services over time.

## How we secure your information

We have engaged GitHub as a supplier to host this project. We and our suppliers take measures reasonably 
necessary to protect User Personal Information from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction; 
maintain data accuracy; and help ensure the appropriate use of User Personal Information.  Our program:

* aligns with industry recognized frameworks;
* includes security safeguards reasonably designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and 
resilience of our users' data;
* is appropriate to the nature, size, and complexity of the project’s goals and mission;
* includes incident response and data breach notification processes; and
* complies with applicable information security related laws and regulations.

In the event of a data breach that affects your User Personal Information, we will act promptly to mitigate the 
impact of a breach and notify any affected users without undue delay.

## Our global privacy practices

**We store and process the information that we collect in the United States and other countries** in accordance 
with this Privacy Statement. However, we understand that we have users from different countries and regions with 
different privacy expectations, and we try to meet those needs even when the United States does not have the same 
privacy framework as other countries'.

We provide the same standard of privacy protection — as described in this Privacy Statement — to all our users 
around the world, regardless of their country of origin or location, and we are proud of the levels of notice, 
choice, accountability, security, data integrity, access, and recourse we provide. We have appointed a Privacy 
Officer and we strive to comply with the applicable data privacy laws wherever we do business, and our Privacy 
Officer works with a cross-functional team that oversees our privacy compliance efforts. Additionally, if our 
vendors or affiliates have access to User Personal Information, they must sign agreements that require them to 
comply with our privacy policies and with applicable data privacy laws.

In particular:
* We provide clear methods of unambiguous, informed consent at the time of data collection, when we do collect your 
personal data using consent as a basis.
* We collect only the minimum amount of personal data necessary for our purposes, unless you choose to provide more. 
We encourage you to only give us the amount of data you are comfortable sharing.
* We offer you simple methods of accessing, correcting, or deleting the User Personal Information we have collected.
* We provide our users notice, choice, accountability, security, and access, and we limit the purpose for processing. 
We also provide our users a method of recourse and enforcement. These are the Privacy Shield Principles, but they are 
also just good practices.

### Cross-border data transfers

For cross-border data transfers from the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA), we adhere to our 
binding corporate rules.  

## How we respond to compelled disclosure

We may disclose personally-identifying information or other information we collect about you to law enforcement in 
response to a valid subpoena, court order, warrant, or similar government order, or when we believe in good faith 
that disclosure is reasonably necessary to prevent injury or to protect our property or rights, or those of third 
parties or the public at large.

In complying with court orders and similar legal processes, we strive for transparency. When permitted, we will 
make a reasonable effort to notify users of any disclosure of their information, unless we are prohibited by law or 
court order from doing so, or in rare, exigent circumstances.

## How we, and others, communicate with you

We will use your email address to communicate with you regarding the project and closely related matters.  We will 
not email you about other matters without your prior permission.  

## Resolving complaints

If you have concerns about the way we are handling your User Personal Information, please let us know immediately. 
We want to help. You may contact us by filling out our use our Data Subject Rights Request Form which is linked at 
[www.johndeere.com/privacy](http://www.johndeere.com/privacy). You may also email us directly at

We will respond promptly — within 45 days at the latest.

You may also contact our Data Protection Officer directly via the contact information available at 
[www.johndeere.com/privacy](http://www.johndeere.com/privacy).  

## Changes to our Privacy Statement

Although most changes are likely to be minor, we may change our Privacy Statement from time to time. We will 
provide notification to Users of material changes to this Privacy Statement through our Website at least 30 days 
prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice at the site or sending email to the primary email address 
specified in your profile. For changes to this Privacy Statement that do not affect your rights, we encourage 
visitors to review this notice regularly.
